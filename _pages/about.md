I have been a research assistant and PhD student in the [Research Group Computer Science “Pro­gram­ming Languages and Verification”](https://verify.rwth-aachen.de/index_e.html) headed by Professor Jürgen Giesl since October 2022.

My research focuses on theoretical computer science: I’m interested in automated reasoning and verification of (probabilistic) programs. In particular, I work on fully automated termination and complexity analysis of functional programs dealing with data structures. For this, I focus on analyzing termination and (expected) complexity of (probabilistic) term rewriting, which is a very basic functional programming language. Moreover, I’m one of the main developers of the [Automated Program Verification Environment (AProVE)](https://aprove.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/) Tool.
