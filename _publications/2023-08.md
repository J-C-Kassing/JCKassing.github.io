**Abstract**:
Dependency pairs are one of the most powerful techniques to analyze termination of term rewrite systems (TRSs) automatically. We adapt the dependency pair framework to the probabilistic setting in order to prove almost-sure innermost termination of probabilistic TRSs. To evaluate its power, we implemented the new framework in our tool AProVE.
