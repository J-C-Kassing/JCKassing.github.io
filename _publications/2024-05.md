**Abstract**:
Recently, we adapted the well-known dependency pair (DP) framework to a dependency tuple framework in order to prove almost-sure innermost termination (iAST) of probabilistic term rewrite systems. While this approach was incomplete, in this paper, we improve it into a complete criterion for iAST by presenting a new, more elegant definition of DPs for probabilistic term rewriting. Based on this, we extend the probabilistic DP framework by new transformations. Our implementation in the tool AProVE shows that they increase its power considerably.
