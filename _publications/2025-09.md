**Abstract**:
The dependency pair (DP) framework is one of the most powerful techniques for automatic termination and complexity analysis of term rewrite systems. While DPs were extended to prove almost-sure termination of probabilistic term rewrite systems (PTRSs), automatic complexity analysis for PTRSs is largely unexplored. We introduce the first DP framework for analyzing expected complexity and for proving positive or strong almost-sure termination (SAST) of innermost rewriting with PTRSs, i.e., finite expected runtime. We implemented our framework in the tool AProVE and demonstrate its power compared to existing techniques for proving SAST.
