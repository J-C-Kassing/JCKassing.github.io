**Abstract**:
Dependency pairs are one of the most powerful techniques to analyze termination of term rewrite systems automatically. We adapt dependency pairs to the probabilistic setting and develop an annotated dependency pair framework for automatically proving almost-sure termination of probabilistic term rewrite systems, both for full and innermost rewriting. To evaluate its power, we implemented our framework in the tool AProVE.
