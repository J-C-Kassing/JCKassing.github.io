**Abstract**:
Dependency pairs are one of the most powerful techniques for proving termination of term rewrite systems (TRSs), and they are used in almost all tools for termination analysis of TRSs. Problem #106 of the RTA List of Open Problems asks for an adaption of dependency pairs for relative termination. Here, infinite rewrite sequences are allowed, but one wants to prove that a certain subset of the rewrite rules cannot be used infinitely often. Dependency pairs were recently adapted to annotated dependency pairs (ADPs) to prove almost-sure termination of probabilistic TRSs. In this paper, we develop a novel adaption of ADPs for relative termination. We implemented our new ADP framework in our tool AProVE and evaluate it in comparison to state-of-the-art tools for relative termination of TRSs.
