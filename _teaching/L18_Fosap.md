The course provides an introduction to formal languages and systems, covering key topics such as grammars (including the Chomsky hierarchy), finite and pushdown automata, and regular expressions, enabling them to apply formal modeling techniques to areas like compiler construction and system verification. In the end, we explore foundational models for concurrent and distributed systems, such as Petri nets. Overall, the course equips students with a strong mathematical and theoretical basis essential for advanced theoretical computer science and formal reasoning.
