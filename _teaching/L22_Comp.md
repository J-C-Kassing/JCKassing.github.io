This lecture is an in-depth introduction of the central topics of the complexity theory.
The topic of the complexity theory are the principle boundaries of efficient computability. For that the complexity theory questions "inherent dificulties" of algorithmic problems. Therefore the question is not, how efficient the algorithm solves a problem, but how efficient a problem can be solved in general. Efficency will be measured acording to the consumption of ressources, like computation time, used memory, or used bandwith.
Especially the comparison of the different ressource dimensions is tricky. This leads to questions like "Can every memory efficent algorithm be simulated through a time efficent algorithm?" or "Do randomized algorithms in principle work better than deterministic ones?".
